# Open University Learning Analytics Dataset Exploration

This repository is for the final project of Developing Data Products in Coursera. 

The app based on the codes from this repo has been published in this link: https://intandea.shinyapps.io/ddp_oulad/

Dataset is based on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Open+University+Learning+Analytics+dataset#. For the purpose of this app, the dataset used is studentInfo.csv. The dataset contains data about courses, students and their interactions with Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for seven selected courses (called modules).

The app is a plot to show relationship between passing the courses and other variables selected by user. The first tab is showing the relationship between number of students passing the assessment and two other variables selected by the user. User also enters a specific number as sample size to subset the dataset. Student is considered passed if his/her final result is either 'Passed' or 'Distinction'. Below is the example of plot from 500 random samples taken from the dataset. The second tab is showing the relationship between final result of the assessment and a variable picked by user from a specific course.
